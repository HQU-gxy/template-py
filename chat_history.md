To build a tree of dependencies and resolve unbounded variables by order, while reporting errors for circular dependencies or unsolvable variables, you will need to implement an algorithm that follows these general steps:

1. **Parse Expressions:**
   Parse all expressions to identify dependencies (unbounded variables) for each expression.

2. **Build Dependency Graph:**
   Construct a directed graph where each node represents an expression or variable, and edges represent dependencies (from dependent to dependency).

3. **Topological Sorting:**
   Perform a topological sort on the dependency graph to determine a valid order for resolving the variables. Topological sorting orders the nodes in a directed graph so that for every directed edge from node `A` to node `B`, `A` comes before `B` in the ordering.

4. **Detect Cycles:**
   If the graph has cycles (i.e., there are circular dependencies), topological sorting will detect them because there will be nodes that cannot be visited in a cycle-free fashion. You'll need to report these as errors.

5. **Resolve Variables:**
   Once a valid sort order is determined, you can resolve the variables in that order, ensuring that each variable's dependencies are resolved before the variable itself is attempted.

6. **Error Reporting:**
   If any variable cannot be resolved due to missing dependencies or other errors, report these as unsolvable variables.

For a more concrete implementation, here's a high-level Python example using the concepts described above:

```python
import networkx as nx

class DependencyResolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = nx.DiGraph()

    def add_dependency(self, var, depends_on):
        # Add a dependency (edge) to the graph.
        # `var` depends on `depends_on`.
        self.graph.add_edge(var, depends_on)

    def resolve_dependencies(self):
        # Check for cycles in the graph indicating circular dependencies.
        try:
            # `nx.topological_sort` will raise an error if a cycle is detected.
            order = list(nx.topological_sort(self.graph))
            return order
        except nx.NetworkXUnfeasible as e:
            # Handle circular dependencies.
            cycle = nx.find_cycle(self.graph, orientation='original')
            raise ValueError(f"Circular dependency detected: {cycle}") from e

# Example usage:

resolver = DependencyResolver()

# Suppose we have the following dependencies:
# A -> B -> C and A -> D, B -> D, C -> E
resolver.add_dependency('A', 'B')
resolver.add_dependency('B', 'C')
resolver.add_dependency('A', 'D')
resolver.add_dependency('B', 'D')
resolver.add_dependency('C', 'E')

try:
    resolve_order = resolver.resolve_dependencies()
    print("Resolve order:", resolve_order)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

# If there is a cycle, e.g., C -> A (creating A -> B -> C -> A),
# the `resolve_dependencies` method will raise a ValueError.
resolver.add_dependency('C', 'A')
try:
    resolve_order = resolver.resolve_dependencies()
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

In this example, `networkx` is used to handle the graph construction and topological sorting. This library provides built-in utilities to detect cycles and perform sort operations which are more efficient and reliable than writing these algorithms from scratch.

Please note that this is a high-level example and does not cover the actual parsing of expressions to identify dependencies or the evaluation of expressions. You would need to integrate this logic with your `LazyExpr` class or similar constructs that encapsulate the expressions and their dependencies.

Additionally, you should handle the situation where a dependency is not defined at all (i.e., it's missing from the graph), which this example does not cover. In such cases, you would need to report these as unsolvable variables.
